    <h1>FocusForce: About the Project</h1>
    <p>Our project is an easy-to-use meeting platform, with mute-unmute, camera, screen share & chatting capabilities.</p>
    <p>Students in online classes often face distractions due to the ease of multitaskingâ€”whether it's playing games, chatting with friends, or browsing the internet. Studies have shown that students' attention spans are fleeting, and they can struggle to stay focused during prolonged sessions.</p>
    <p>Our platform aims to solve this problem by preventing students from opening distracting apps or accessing unauthorized websites during class sessions. By blocking external apps, browsers, and chatbots during live classes or exams, we help ensure that students remain focused on the lecture at hand.</p>
